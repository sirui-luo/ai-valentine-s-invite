## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This project was built using a structured AI-assisted workflow combining:

- **Gemini AI Studio**
- **Cursor**
- **ChatGPT**

---

### 1️⃣ Idea & UX Brainstorming — ChatGPT

Used ChatGPT to:
- Explore interaction ideas
- Design playful “No button” behavior
- Improve animation concepts
- Refine UI logic and user flow

---

### 2️⃣ Structured Prompt Engineering — Gemini AI Studio

I used a structured prompting framework based on:

**Task → Context → Reference → Evaluate → Iterate**

Example structure:

- **Task**: Build a Valentine’s invite web app with envelope animation.
- **Context**: React + Vite project, client-side only.
- **Reference**: Romantic theme, handwritten font, pink/red palette.
- **Evaluate**: Ensure animation timing feels elegant and emotional.
- **Iterate**: Refine UX and simplify UI.

Gemini AI Studio generated:
- Initial component structure
- Animation scaffolding
- Envelope SVG logic
- Core layout files

---

### 3️⃣ Iteration & Refinement — Cursor

Cursor was used to:
- Refactor code
- Improve animation timing (2.3s romantic reveal)
- Debug browser audio autoplay behavior
- Simplify state management
- Polish UI details

## 🎵 Music Setup

To avoid browser autoplay issues, the app uses a local MP3 file.

Place your music file inside: public/romantic.mp3

It will then be accessible at: http://localhost:3000/romantic.mp3

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
